Seventh Website Project
#Travel Agency (Angular)

Task description

In this CodeReview, you have to create a travel agency web application using Angular.

GUI guideline note:  You can use a prepared Bootstrap or a simple HTML/CSS theme (without Bootstrap), you are also allowed to create your own theme. Our recommendation is to use a prepared theme (keep it simple), so you can focus more on the Angular part of the project.

You need to create at least three pages Home, Blog and Travels (you are free to create additional pages if you have time and inspiration). Home and Blog should have the static content. The travel page should have a form for inserting info about travels as well as a list of the travels. For the bonus part you should create a filter for the travels in your App.

Please examine the designs below as a suggestion:

Home, blog and any other page with the static content can have this kind of design. Feel free to provide your content for the Content section

The travel page will have a form. After the form section it should be the content in cards (using bootstrap)


For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

- Implement theme design, or design similar to the screenshots above. 

- Your project must contain at least 5 components that will build your project

- Use routing to move between the pages. E.g.: your navbar contains 3 navigation links: Home - Blog - Travels. When you click Home you should see the content for the homepage.     When you click Blog you should see the content for the Blog page and the Travels page will show all travel offers.

- Each travel offer should display the following details: destination, description, start date(s), duration and price. 

- Create the functionality that when you click on a travel offer in the travel section, it will be added to your cart.

- Display the shopping cart in a seperate component.

Bonus Points:

- Display the final sum of all the offers the users have selected(i.e Total costs)

- If the total sum is more than EUR 200,-, the users get a 10% discount. If the total sum is more than EUR 500,-, then it is a 20% discount.
